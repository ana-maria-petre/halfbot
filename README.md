# HalfBot

**Not the best chatbot you've had, but it tries its best.**  

HalfBot is a simple chatbot built using [Microsoft's DialoGPT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium).  
It’s a little unpredictable and always ready to chat — just don’t expect perfection! :)  
It’s not the smartest chatbot you’ll meet, and sometimes it might say unexpected things. 

> ⚠️ Note: HalfBot is intentionally simple and playful.  
> Sometimes it may give inconsistent, vague, or even slightly “mean” replies.  
> This is not intentional — it’s just how DialoGPT predicts text!

Remember: HalfBot **cannot feel, think, or understand** like a human.
